# Offline URL Shortener

## What This Project Does
A simple Python tool that takes long URLs and assigns short codes, storing the mapping in a local file (`url_data.json`).  
Later, you can enter the short code to retrieve the original URL no internet needed!

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python URL_Shortener.py 
   and follow the steps.
