# 🌟 Code of Conduct

Welcome to the **NeuroByte Society Weekend Projects Repo**!  
We’re here to **learn together, build together**, and grow as a community.

To ensure an inclusive and respectful environment, we expect everyone to follow this Code of Conduct:

---

## ✅ Be Respectful
Treat all contributors with respect. There’s no such thing as a “dumb question” — we’re all learning.

## ✅ Be Friendly and Welcoming
Encourage others. Celebrate successes, help when someone’s stuck, and be positive in feedback.

## ✅ Be Open to Feedback
Constructive suggestions are part of learning. Accept and offer feedback respectfully.

## ✅ Help Beginners
If you’re experienced, guide others with patience. If you're new, ask without fear.

## ❌ No Harassment
Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.

If you observe behavior that violates this Code, please report it via:
- Club leads or maintainers
